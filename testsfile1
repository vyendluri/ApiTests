For each of these stories, acceptance criteria would be something like:
Acceptance Criteria:
Setup appropriate staging data for each endpoint that reflects various application states and scenarios (success, validation errors, server errors, edge cases).

Implement automated tests for the API endpoints using C# and SpecFlow.

Create SpecFlow features and scenarios for each API endpoint.

Scenarios should cover all expected outcomes (success, validation errors, server errors) and any specific business rules.

Define step definitions for each step in the scenarios. These should call the appropriate API function and perform assertions to validate the response.

Execute the automated tests to identify any issues and ensure the correctness of each endpoint.

Validate the correctness of the data retrieved by comparing it with the expected results.

Ensure the tests run successfully in the local environment and also against the staging data.

Include these tests in the continuous integration pipeline to be run on every build.
